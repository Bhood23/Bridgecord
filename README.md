## How Does It Work?

Bridgecord leverages the powerful APIs of Guilded.gg and Discord.py. By connecting a websocket to Guilded and using a Discord bot to read and send messages, Bridgecord efficiently relays messages between the two platforms. This bot can be hosted locally on any device with Python and pip, making it accessible and easy to deploy.
